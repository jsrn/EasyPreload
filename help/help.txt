--32bit          If you are trying to intercept calls from a 32 bit application
                 on a 64 bit system, use this flag to compile the intercepting
                 function as a 32 bit library.

--persist 	 Without this flag, the changes to LD_PRELOAD and PATH last only
                 so long as the child shell spawned by EasyPreload. Using this 
		 flag will edit ~/.bashrc to ensure that the changes are kept 
		 across login/terminal sessions.

--stealth        "Stealth" is probably a grand term. This just means that the
                 intercepting library is stored somewhere less obvious than the
                 directory in which EasyPreload was executed. By default,
		 the directory '...' is created and used in the working dir.

--list-modules	 Spits out the list of available modules.
