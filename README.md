EasyPreload
===========

Intercept system calls with LD_PRELOAD and your choice of customisable modules. This is an experimental project intended primarily for my own education, and spawns from my solution to the following OverTheWire challenge:

The standard disclaimer about educational use applies, though it will frankly be a long time before this project is in a state to be used at all, let alone for shenanigans.
